# PerOne

### A simple bit flipping encryption program

## Modules

### Crypt

The crypt module encrypts or decrypts an input file by flipping bits specified by a key.

### Keygen

The keygen module generates key files for a file that is encrypted

## Future

### Functionality

- directory encryption
- buffered encryption to reduce memory stress
- pipelines: generate key and encrypt file with one step
- bit scrambling: rather than just flipping bits, rearranging them is also an effective means of encrypting data
